# solution
- ssh to the docker
- search files and directories
- find .lost+found/flag.txt
  - belongs to another group *pacman*
  - only owner and group can read
- find /home/pacman/.\"\\\?\$\*\'N\'\*\$\?\\\" and read the content -> a password
- find /home/pacman/.bash-history
  - `man sg` is a hint to the `sg command` (switch group)
- `sg pacman -c 'cat /home/clyde/.lost+found/flag.txt'` 
  - enter password
