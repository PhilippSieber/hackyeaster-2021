# solution
At the end of sunshine.png from the sunshine challenge is additional content in the file; getting it with strings won't work, the file has to be either viewd in a hex-editor or with cat and then formatted to get the flag

Insert a linebreak like every 16 characters:

```
 _              
| |__           
| '_ \          
| | | |         
|_| |_|         
  ___           
 / _ \          
|  __/           
 \___|           
 ____           
 |___ \            
  __) |          
 / __/          |_____|           ___            / _ \       
[...]
```
